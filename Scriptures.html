         <p style="font-size:20px;">Jesus, after healing a lame man, was being accused by Jews in the temple at Jerusalem for healing a man on the sabbath. He replies, "My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.
"(v.17)<br>
  The Jews then seek to kill him, not only for healing on the sabbath. But now he's making himself out to be equal to God?! Jesus is about to tell them ,in so many words, who he is: 
                  <em>(Deuteronomy 19:15  One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity, or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.) </em>
<br> 
<br>
Jesus isnt just making some bold, outlandish statement. He's got witnesses. He mentions John the Baptist (v32-33), and then he mentions the Father himself, which sent him (v.37). He goes on to say,<br>
                      <em><strong>"You dont have the Father's word in you, because you don't believe the one he sent...<br>
 Search the scriptures [Old Testament], thats how you find out how to get eternal life, and they also testify of me"</strong></em>

After eating from the tree God commanded Adam and Eve, God brought death on the scene. Then he curses Satan to not be able to pop up directly in the sight of man, but delivered him to chains of darkness<br><em> (2 Peter 2:4
“For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;”)</em> <br>

6 And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them, <br>
7 And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set [him] thereon. <br>
8 And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed [them] in the way.<br>
 9 And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying,<em style="color:aqua"> Hosanna to the Son of David:</em><br> Blessed [is] he that cometh in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.

<p class="ass">As Jesus approches Jerusalem he tells his disciples to go into a village and to bring him an ass to ride.<br>
  This was done to fulfill a scripture found in Zechariah 9:9:<br>
  <em><strong>9 Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion;<br>
  Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem:<br>
  Behold, thy King cometh unto thee:<br>
  He is just, and having salvation;<br>
  Lowly, and riding upon an ass</strong></em>

34 They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted [thereof], he would not drink.<br>
 35 And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, <br>They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots. <br>
36 And sitting down they watched him there;<br>
37 And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. <br>
38 Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand, and another on the left. ... <br><br>

45 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.<br>
 46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, <em style="color: rgb(255, 133, 133)">Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</em>

<p> 
  A fulfillment of a couple of psalms written by David, 
  really, Jesus is speaking through the mouth of David in the psalms:<br>
  Psalm 69: 21<br>
  <em><strong>They gave me also gall for my meat; 
  and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</strong></em><br>
  Psalm 22: 1, 18
<br><em><strong>
1 My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
Why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?<br>

...
<br>
18 They part my garments among them,
And cast lots upon my vesture.</strong></em>
<br>
None of this happened to David in his reign, or anyone else written in Israel's history... so who is David talking about?
David is prophecying about the Messiah, Jesus himself!

<p>As Jesus is preparing to be crucified, he prays to the Father, but he says something very interesting...<br>
 <em> "..Glorify me with the glory I had with you before the world was..."</em><br>
 Wait! Jesus had some sort of existence before the world? Yes! (John 1: 1-2, Hebrews 1:1-2)
